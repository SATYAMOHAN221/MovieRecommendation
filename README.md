# Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques applied to the TMDB 5000 movies dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that recommends movies to users based on various features such as genre, cast, crew, and keywords. The recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and provide suggestions tailored to user preferences.

- Movie titles
- Genres
- Cast and crew
- Keywords
- Overview
- Release dates
- Popularity
- Vote counts and averages
